<a name="setupwizard"><h2>Setup Wizard</h2></a>
First visit to the site will detect that the database needs to be prepared and redirect you to the Setup Wizard (/install/wizard). Server tests will be ran to ensure a few required components are present such as encryption and image libraries. If any test fails, you will need to install the missing component on the server and try again before the install wizard will be able to continue.

<h3>Sample Data</h3>
After the installation completes, you are presented with the option to install Sample Data. This will add a few brands, groups, users, menus, etc. so that you can dive right into getting familiar with the system and not have to add these manually to start testing.
